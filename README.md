# Malware Detection in Android Applications

## Introduction
This project aims to detect malware in Android applications by analyzing their permission requirements. Through a structured approach, we develop a machine learning model with high accuracy and operationalize it into a user-friendly application for real-world use.

## Phases Overview
1. **Data Discovery:** Identifying potential data sources, framing the problem, and understanding key stakeholders.
2. **Data Collection and Preparation:** Cleaning and structuring the dataset for analysis.
3. **Model Planning:** Planning the models for malware detection.
4. **Model Building:** Constructing the Neural Networks based machine learning model.
5. **Communicate Results:** Evaluating model performance and potential applications.
6. **Operationalize:** Deploying the model into a user-friendly application.

## Key Highlights
- **Initial Hypothesis:** Applications with excessive permissions are more likely to contain malware.
- **Data Conditioning:** No missing values found, dataset split into training and testing sets.
- **Applications:** Enhancing mobile security solutions, app marketplaces, and enterprise security.

### Recommendations:
- Validate model performance on additional datasets.
- Assess feasibility of real-world deployment.
- Continuous model monitoring and updating.
