## Phase 1: Data Discovery
### Introduction
Phase 1 focuses on data discovery, initial hypotheses formulation, potential data sources identification, business domain exploration, problem framing, and key stakeholders identification.

### Initial Hypothesis
- Applications with excessive and unnecessary permission requirements are more likely to contain malware.
- Malware authors often exploit permissions granted to apps for malicious activities such as stealing personal information or accessing sensitive data.

### Identifying Potential Data Sources
1. Google Play Store
2. Third-party app markets
3. Malware analysis platforms
4. App metadata checks for insights on malware signatures and behaviors.

### Learning the Business Domain
- Understanding app permissions and familiarizing with malware detection techniques.
- Checking regulatory frameworks to ensure compliance.
- Understanding different types of permissions and existing methodologies for detecting malware.

### Resources Available
- Application metadata, developers, and cybersecurity experts.
- Obtaining permission data from sources.
- Understanding tactics employed by malicious users to exploit app permissions.

### Framing the Problem
- **Goal:** Automatically detect potentially malicious apps based on their permission requirements.
- **Approach:** Analyzing permission patterns to identify common characteristics associated with malware.
- **Criteria:** Developing a basis to quantify the risk associated with different permissions.
- **Result:** Model predicting the likelihood of an app being malware based on its permission requirements.

### Identifying Key Stakeholders
1. Application Users
2. Application Developers
3. Regulatory Bodies
4. Cybersecurity Personnel

## Phase 2: Data Collection and Preparation
### Introduction
Phase 2 involves the collection and preparation of data for further analysis to establish a clean and structured dataset suitable for training machine learning models.

### Preparing the Analytic Sandbox
- Isolated environment set up in VSCode for data exploration and analysis.

### Performing ELT and Outlier Visualization
- Initial dataset comprised 29,335 unique data entries with 86 feature columns representing permissions.
- Outlier visualization techniques used to identify abnormal values, distinguishing malware from non-malware entries.

### Learning about the Data
- Formulated initial hypothesis regarding excessive permissions and malware.
- Dataset contained information about permissions used by applications and their corresponding malware presence.

### Data Conditioning
- No missing values found, dataset in binary format.
- Outlier removal techniques applied.
- Dataset split into training and testing sets.

### Tools Used
- Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, VSCode, Excel

## Phase 3: Model Planning
### Introduction
Phase 3 involves planning the models for detecting malware presence in Android applications based on their permission requirements.

### Feature Selection
- Z-score analysis employed to identify features significantly deviating from the mean.
- Two features with highest z-scores removed from the dataset.

### Model Types
- Regression and Sequential Neural Network considered.
- Sequential Neural Network chosen for binary classification with non-continuous data.

## Phase 4: Model Building
### Overall Structure
- Sequential neural network architecture with input layer, hidden layer, and final layer.
